<!-- Parameters: when using an API, the first thing to always do is read the documentation. Doing so
    will prevent bugs down the line and undertsanding how to use built in parameters will only
    make your life easier, espcially when dealing with large databases. There are several types of
    parameters. Header Parameters and Path Parameters. -->

    <!-- Path Parameters are within the path of the endpoint. The endpoint is where teh API accesses the information
    it needs to response. Typically, path parameters are seperated by a "/". An example of this is a following request
    to the Star Wars API.
    HTTPS://swapi.dev/api/people/1 -->

    <!-- Had the one not been added to the endpoint, "/people" will have returned all people or characters within the
    Star Wars Universe. -->

    <!-- Querystring parameters appear after a "?" in the endpoint. The "?" is followed by the parameters and their 
    values, which is commonly refered to as the Querystring. When used properly, this provides the easiest
    way to add basic filtering to restful APIs. -->

    <!-- How to add Querystring parameters: to add Querystring parameters, a "?" is added to the endpoint, after
    the base URL, and the path parameters if any. Following the "?" are the Querystrings which specify specific parameters
    and values. -->

    <!-- For Example: HTTP://exampleapi.com/{path-parameter}?parameter=value the parameters can be chained on, one
    right after the other with an "&", seperating them. The specific order of the parameters do not matter.  -->

    <!-- Querystrings very among APIs with large API databases, querystring parameters include limit, offset, and page.
    Limit provides the number of resorces / instances you want to return, while offset dictates where to start the 
    count from. They're often used in conjunction with each other as the following example. -->

    <!-- HTTPS://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=7&offset=24 . This is asking the pokemon API to send back 7 pokemon 
    instances, beginning at number 25. -->

    <!-- The page is similar to limit and offset except that there is already a built in limit on how
    many instances are rendered and the developer just needs a page parameter to access the next/preview
    set of data. The following example from the Rick and Morty API, has a built in limit which shows 20
    characters per page. -->
